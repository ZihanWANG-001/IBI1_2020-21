South Korea, Kenya, and Colombia are three countries in different parts of the world, but with similar populations. How have the total cases developed over time in those three countries?
The codes to answer this question start at line 94.
From the plot, we can see that the COVID-19 pandemic in South Korea starts the earliest among these three countries and there was a rapid increase in total cases from late February to early March in 2020. Then, the rate of the outbreak began to slow down from 2020-3-15. The total cases in South Korea are the highest among these countries at the end of 2020-3-30. However, the total cases in Kenya kept very low (close to zero). The total cases in Colombia were a little bit higher than Kenya at the end of 2020-3-30. It started to slowly increase around 2020-3-21.
Although these three countries have similar populations, the total cases in South Korea developed the most rapidly and almost reached 10000. In Kenya and Colombia, the total cases developed very slowly over time. This might because South Korea is the closest to China and the population mobility there is higher than Kenya and Colombia.
