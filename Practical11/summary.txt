Findings:
1. For the comparison between human and mouse SOD2:
The alignment score is 1091.
The percentage of identical amino acids is 89.6%.
2. For the comparison between human and random:
The alignment score is -250.
The percentage of identical amino acids is 5.4%.
3. For the comparison between mouse and random:
The alignment score is -250.
The percentage of identical amino acids is 5.86%.
Interpretation:
The higher the alignment score is, the more similar the two sequences are. Therefore, the similarity between human and mouse SOD2 is quite high, compared to the result of the findings 2 and 3. This might because the protein SOD2 plays a fundamental role in the cells. It is conserved during the evolution.
