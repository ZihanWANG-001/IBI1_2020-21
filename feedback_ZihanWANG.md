My Respond to the Formative Feedback: 
In my Week6's code for coronavirus infection rates, I forgot to add the title to the pie chart, which was kindly pointed out in the feedback.
To address this, I add a line of code: plt.title('The Proportion of COVID-19 Infections in the Top Five Most Affected Countries').
Apart from this, other things are well.
